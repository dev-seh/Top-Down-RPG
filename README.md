//DISCLAIMER: This project was my submit for a game developer interview. The task was to create a shop mechanic. I had zero experience with github and unity projects back then so it ended up being a mess. It has duplicate scripts and several errors. It's a shame because I really liked how it looked/felt. I highly encourage you to try it in the executable version above.//

During this game development assignment, I adopted a methodical and step-by-step
approach to build a captivating gaming experience. Here's a summary of the development
process:

Tilemaps, Player, and Camera Viewport: I initiated the project by establishing the
fundamental game structure, including tilemaps, player object, and camera viewport. This
provided the groundwork for the game world and enabled me to develop the overall visual
style and functionality.

Player Movement and Collisions: Next, I focused on implementing player movement using
C# scripts and configured collision tilemaps for walls and water. This ensured fluid and
responsive controls for the player character, enhancing the gameplay experience.

Animation and Camera Movement: I refined the animation system by employing a more
advanced approach, allowing for smoother player movement in different directions.
Additionally, I integrated a Cinemachine camera to follow the player, creating a more
immersive and dynamic gaming experience.

Shop Design and Currency System: I concentrated on developing the in-game economy by
designing the shop interior, incorporating a shopkeeper character, and creating a fully
functional currency system. I also introduced skin items for the player, laying the groundwork
for the inventory and shop system.

Hotkey Inventory and Shop Mechanics: I completed the shop and inventory system,
implementing a hotkey inventory where purchased items are stored. This offered players a
seamless and user-friendly way to manage their in-game items.

Player Appearance Customization: I introduced equipment functionality, enabling players to
assign items to hotkeys, equip them, and alter their character's appearance dynamically.
Pressing the hotkey again unequips the item, providing a versatile customization system.

Building Mechanics and Additional Skins: I expanded the game world by incorporating
unique building mechanics, such as a store roof that becomes transparent when the player
enters, enhancing the immersion. I also added two more skins, seamlessly integrating them
into the existing customization system.

SFX, BGM and Immersive Experience: Finally, I enriched the game with various sound
effects, including buy/sell sounds, background music, ambience, and footsteps. This addition
created a more immersive and engaging gameplay experience, wrapping up the project.

In conclusion, my development process prioritized a balanced blend of functionality, visual
appeal, and player experience. Through this approach, I was able to create a polished and
enjoyable game that offers players a memorable and captivating gaming experience.
